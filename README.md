Of course it can be used in other places, because it does not rely on Qt, but uses Qt to build.
You can use it under `Windows` and `Linux`.
`Openssl-devel` needs to be installed under Linux.
The `test` project is used for source code debugging.
The `x509lib` project is used to generate shared libraries.
